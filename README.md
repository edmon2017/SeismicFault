# Seismic Fault interpretation

Reflection Seismic is a geophysical method used for subsurface exploration in the oil and gas industry. This method is based on the analysis of seismic waves recorded after these has traveled trough the subsurface rocks.

Part of the key information preovided for this method is the location of geological faults, which are zones were the rocks has been broken and displaced. The identification of the faults is a key taks because these can related to hydrocarbon acumulations, and also becaouse the faults can be associated to hazards for the drilling operations. 

However the fault interpretation, is a complex task, wich relies on the interpreter experience and consumes a lot of time.

The goal for this project is to automatize the fault interpretation process, to save time and reduce the subjectivity of this process.
